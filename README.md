MotleyBots Metaverse Experiments

Currently this will be the IPFS based viewing branch. The goal is to have this go up on IPFS as an immutable way to view the NFTs.

It is on hold until I get the creation/modification interface completed.  

Displays randomized islands and 'structures' for now.

Goals after the creation/modification side are completed.
 - EVM hookup
 - 1st person camera movement
 - NFT or Address search
 - GLB/PNG hookups reactivated
